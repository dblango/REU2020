# Introduction

  The 2020 Harvard Research for undergraduates Program was funded by the National Science Foundation. The proposed project revolved around analyzing the genome-scaled data of brood parasitic birds. Although the project focused on bird genomes, the skills that were learned are broadly applicable in many science-realted fields. It allowed me to understand that the methods and science behind evolutionary biology are central to the future of personalized medicine for humans as well. I learned how computational biology is relevant to the environment and boosted my skills in computer programming, which will be very useful in a variety of careers.
  This project characterized patterns of genomic change in both parasitic and non-parasitic birds to test whether changes in the same specific genes and/or parallel patterns of genomic change have occurred in independent brood parasitic lineages. I was able to successfully identify unknown pieces of chromosomes and categorize them as Z-linked, W-linked, or autosomal. The project also examined the unique evolutionary dynamics of the sex-determination chromosomes. The results provided insight into fundamental questions about genome evolution and will provide other reseearchers with mapped genomes of speicies and reliable references that will further their research. Below you will find a breif summary of the codes and steps I used to analyze the data given to me. 


To install the tidyverse package, use 
`install.packages("tidyverse")`

##In order to use the package you must load the package every time you start a new session
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Made a reference genome based on a female reference genome obtained from NCBI.
```{bash, eval = F}
module load bwa/0.7.17-fasrc01
bwa index -p hetAtr 00_genome/GCA_011075105.1_BPBGC_Hatr_1.0_genomic.fna.gz
```

## The sample genes were mapped. A sam file was created for each sample. 
```{bash, eval = F}
module load bwa/0.7.17-fasrc01

R1=$1
name=`echo $R1 | sed 's/_1.fastq.gz\+//'`
R2=${name}_2.fastq.gz
#run mapping
bwa mem -t 8 -R '@RG\tID:${name}\tSM:${name}' 00_genome/hetAtr $R1 $R2 > $name.sam
```

## Once the same files were converted into bam files, one large bam file was made for each of the 14 indiviuals that contained all the information pertaining to the individual. 
```{bash, eval = F}
module load samtools/1.10-fasrc01
samtools merge -f -b indv1.txt indv1.final.bam
samtools merge -f -b indv2.txt indv2.final.bam
samtools merge -f -b indv3.txt indv3.final.bam
```

## The coverage of each indivdual was calculated in order to determine the scaffolds associated with sex chromosomes by comparing between males and females.  
```{bash, eval = F}
module load samtools/1.10-fasrc01
samtools coverage indv1.final.bam > indv1.out
samtools coverage indv2.final.bam > indv2.out
```

## Identified three possible autosomal scaffolds to explore coverage and compare other scaffolds against and make sure sex chromosomes were actually sex chromosomes in the males and females:
CM021752.1  1 5558834
CM021757.1  1 5765391
CM021758.1  1 5737139

#COMBINING AUTOSOMAL AND SEX CHROMOSOMES TO PLOT FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO INDENTIFY GENDER
#Of the 14 individuals, Males and Females were identified since, compared to autosomes, males should have an overlapping rate and females should have a different rate. 

#Example: FEMALE (indiviual 8)
```{r, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
auto <- read_delim('auto_cov8.txt', delim = '\t', col_names = F) %>%
  rename(scaffold = X1, pos = X2, cov = X3) %>%
  mutate(chr = 'auto') %>%
  select(chr, cov)
sex <- read_delim('i8.txt', delim = '\t', col_names = F) %>%
  rename(scaffold = X1, pos = X2, cov = X3) %>%
  mutate(chr = 'sex')
as <- bind_rows(auto, sex)
indv8 <- ggplot(as, aes(cov, color = chr,y = ..density..)) + geom_freqpoly(alpha = 0.5, position = 'identity', binwidth = 3)
indv8
```
# Above is the code that will generate the graph formulated below for individual 8. 
```{r}
![](/n/holyscratch01/informatics/blangod/hetAtr/02_bams/indv8.png)
```
#x-axis: coverage, y-axis: density, The autosomes and sex chromosomes of individual 8 shows that the rates of each set of chromosomes differ, this holds to be true in females because the autosomes have half the data that females hold as they have heterozygous sex chromosomes (ZW).

#Example: MALE (individual 3)
```{r, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
auto <- read_delim('auto_cov3.txt', delim = '\t', col_names = F) %>%
  rename(scaffold = X1, pos = X2, cov = X3) %>%
  mutate(chr = 'auto') %>%
  select(chr, cov)
sex <- read_delim('i3.txt', delim = '\t', col_names = F) %>%
  rename(scaffold = X1, pos = X2, cov = X3) %>%
  mutate(chr = 'sex')
as <- bind_rows(auto, sex)
indv3 <- ggplot(as, aes(cov, color = chr,y = ..density..)) + geom_freqpoly(alpha = 0.5, position = 'identity', binwidth = 3)
indv3
```
# Above is the code that will generate the graph formulated below for individual 3. 

```{r}
![Male Indvidual 3](/n/holyscratch01/informatics/blangod/hetAtr/02_bams/indv3.png)
```
#x-axis: coverage, y-axis: density, The autosomes and sex chromosomes of individual 3 shows that the rates of each set of chromosomes overlap each other. This holds to be true in males because the autosomes have the same the data that males hold as they have homozygous sex chromosomes (WW).

## Merged all females into one bam file and all males into another bam file
```{r}
samtools merge fem.final.bam indv4.final.bam indv5.final.bam indv6.final.bam indv7.final.bam indv8.final.bam indv9.final.bam indv10.final.bam indv14.final.bam

samtools merge male.final.bam indv1.final.bam indv2.final.bam indv3.final.bam indv11.final.bam indv12.final.bam indv13.final.bam
```

## Identified scaffolds associated with sex chromosomes by calculating covergae between the male and female larger combined files 
```{r}
samtools coverage fem.final.bam > female.out
samtools coverage male.final.bam > male.out
```

## FINDING THE TOTAL COVERAGE OF MALES AND FEMALES
